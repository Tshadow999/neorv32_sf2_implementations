# NEORV32 Flash implementation

In this thesis project I will use Libero to implement the NEORV32 CPU on to an Smart-Fusion 2 FPGA.

# Benchmarking
Inside the coremark_logs directory, there are some benchmarks.
- Standard has no extensions.
- Performance has extensions: `C`, `M`, `Zfinx` and `FAST_MUL_EN`, `FAST_SHIFT_EN` set to `true`.
